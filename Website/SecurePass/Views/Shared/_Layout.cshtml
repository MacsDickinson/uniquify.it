            <h2>What is it?</h2>
            <p>
                These days one of the biggest threats to personal online security is 
                password reuse. SecurePass attempts to solve this problem by making it 
                simple to use a unique password for every site you log into without 
                having to memorize a huge list of them. SecurePass translates your 
                secret word into a secure password using the domain of the site you 
                are logging in to. This means that all you need to remember is your 
                secret word, no more password protected documents containing lists of 
                secure passwords, no more online password managers that could be 
                potentially hacked themselves. SecurePass doesn't know what your 
                secret word is and it doesn't know any of your passwords, it just 
                translates it into a secure password within your browser. And if the 
                unexpected happens and someone manages to hack into one of your accounts 
                they don't get access to all of your other accounts. And don't worry; 
                the passwords generated by SecurePass can't be converted back to your 
                secret word, especially not the super secure password.

            <h2>How do I use it?</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you know why using SecurePass is such a great idea, how do 
                you go about actually using it? Well first of all you can test how it 
                works on this site, enter the domain for the site you’re logging in 
                to and your secret word and see what happens. But you don’t want to 
                be coming onto this site every time you need to log in to something 
                so go ahead and install our Google Chrome plugin. This plugin attaches 
                to your browser giving you the option to use SecurePass directly in 
                the sites you know. Not using Google Chrome? Have no fear, install our 
                bookmarklet to convert the password for you.
