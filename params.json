{"name":"Uniquify.it","tagline":"uniquify.it is a Google Chrome plugin for generating unique passwords on the fly","body":"## What is it?\r\nThese days one of the most exploited threats to personal online security is password re-use. Uniquify.it attempts to solve this problem by making it simple to use a unique, secure password for every different site you log into, without having to memorize a huge list of convoluted password combinations. Uniquify.it transforms your secret word into a secure password that is unique to each domain you log into. This means that all you need to remember is your secret word; no more password protected documents containing lists of secure passwords and no more online password managers that could potentially be hacked.\r\n\r\nUniquify.it generates your unique password within your browser rather than somewhere in ‘The Cloud’. This means that your secret word and your password are not transferred over the internet, making it impossible for hackers to intercept - unless they are stood behind you, with a video phone, filming your fingers typing.\r\n\r\nIf the unexpected happens and one of your accounts is compromised, the hackers won’t be able to access your other accounts as each website has its own unique password. Uniquify.it uses an industry standard algorithm to generate your password which means there is no danger of hackers recovering your secret word.\r\n\r\n## How do I use it?\r\nUsing Uniquify.it is simple. Uniquify.it is currently only available through this website, however a Google Chrome extension is in development which will allow users to simpler enter your secret word on any log-in page.\r\n\r\nFor more information and updates about uniquify.it, see [macsdickinson.com](http://www.macsdickinson.com).\r\n\r\n© 2014 Macs Dickinson\r\nThe information on this page is licensed under a [Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).
